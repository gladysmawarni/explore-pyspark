# Exploring big data using PySpark

This repo consists of my notebooks that i created while exploring and learning to use PySpark. <br>
_To be updated with exploration on MLlib_

## [Open Food Facts Data Analysis](https://github.com/gladysmawarni/exploring-pyspark/blob/main/openfood_analysis.ipynb)
This notebook consists of the very basics of PySpark. I used the data from [openfoodfacts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) to simulate working with a huge dataset (>6GB) that i cannot process with Pandas using the computational power that i have.<br>
_Open food facts is an open-source database that contains  nutrition facts for food products sold in each country, and all nutrition information._ <br>
<br>
With this dataset i explore how to do data cleaning and data exploration using PySpark, and manage to answer some questions i found interesting: <br>
1. Which food categories has on average the best and worst nutriscore?
2. Which country has on average the best nutriscore?
3. Which country on average do more exports?

What is inside of this notebook by no means are the best practice on cleaning the data and answering the questions. My objective is to be familiar with PySpark syntax and understand how to do the methods that i usually use with Pandas.
